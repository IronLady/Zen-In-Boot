Zen Cart Themes Based on Twitter Bootstrap

Here is the list of what you get from this themes :

1. Responsive design

2. Sticky header with colapsible menu.

3. Nice Button (You must activate CSS Button on Configuration->Layout Setting)

4. Nice pager (Prev-Next on product info page) and Nice Pagination (<Prev|1|2|3|4|Next>)

5. Product grid layout

6. I have tried to minimize the number of "hacks" on non-templates files, this is the list of non-templates that need to be modified :

- includes/classes/split_page_results.php -> Pagination
- includes/functions/html_output -> CSS Button
- includes/language/english/php -> Change "...more info" to "More Info"
- includes/modules/pages/specials/main_template_vars.php -> Fix grid style on specials page

7. There is something else, i forget it :D

You can contribute here, it would be my pleasure to develop it together and give something back to the community to make Zen Cart better.

Thanks
